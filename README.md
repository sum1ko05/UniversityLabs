# UniversityLabs
This is repo for storing (and showing) laboratory work for my uni.

If you plan to use my code from this repo you should understand how it works.
I made this repo public only for educational purporses for other people. 
(if you'll just copy/paste my code you'll probably fail to explain how it works)
